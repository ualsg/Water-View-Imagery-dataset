## Introduction
We capture and segment a new dataset of on-water perspectives, which is designed for semantic segmentation of water level scenarios and can assist waterscape-related segmentation applications. We name it Water View Imagery dataset, and it contains 500 high-resolution images and each segmented imagery with a size of 2048 x 1536 pixels. These images in this dataset come from the Mapillary platform, and these are from 8 cities' water areas: Amsterdam, Bangkok, Chicago, Istanbul, Japan, London, Paris, and Venice.
A total of **15 categories** are selected for annotation, namely: 

* water 
* sky
* terrain 
* traditional building
* modern building
* revetment 
* bridge 
* car 
* truck 
* bicycle 
* boat 
* tree 
* grass 
* people 
* void
